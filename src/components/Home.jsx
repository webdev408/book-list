        This app shows how one can build a Create, Read, Update and Delete
        functionalities in an app without using any libraries, plugins and
        frameworks. It is completely from scratch. It can be further developed
        with data in the backend or in json server. However, the intent here is
        to show a simple but fully functional CRUD app without being bogged down in
        data and server side.
